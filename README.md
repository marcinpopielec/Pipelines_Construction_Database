## About
The project is based on my experiences from a previous job. As a member of the construction site quality team, we had to gather a lot of information about the object we were building. We stored this data in Excel in the form of tables. So we had dozens of tables with thousands of records in them. In my opinion, using a relational database would solve many of the problems we encountered and would significantly speed up the work.

Let's imagine we want to build a pipeline. We must prove that every connection between elements has been made strictly in accordance with standards, specifications and customer requirements. To do this, we need to document:
- welder's certificate (proving that he has the appropriate qualifications)
- certificate of the company's welding technology (to check whether the company can perform this type of weld)
- material certificate (to check whether the material from which we build the pipeline is appropriate)
- what types of post-weld examinations have been used and reports containing test results...  
and much much more other issues.  
I decided to store all this information in a database.  

The main goals of this project are:

1. Learning how to design a database.
2. Learning how to code and solve problems in Oracle database environment using PL/SQL.
3. After completing the project and designing a user-friendly application, it will probably be the first tool in the world to significantly facilitate and speed up the work of engineers on the construction site.
