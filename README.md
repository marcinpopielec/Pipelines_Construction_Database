# Pipelines_Construction_Database
First database for construction site
The project is based on my experiences from a previous job. As a member of the construction site quality team, we had to gather a lot of information about the object we were building. We stored this data in Excel in the form of tables. So we had dozens of tables with thousands of records in them. In my opinion, using a relational database would solve many of the problems we encountered and would significantly speed up the work.
